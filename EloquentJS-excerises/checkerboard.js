/*Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.*/

let size = 8;
const spaceHash = " #";
const hashSpace = "# ";

for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(spaceHash.repeat(size / 2));
  } else {
    console.log(hashSpace.repeat(size / 2));
  }
}
