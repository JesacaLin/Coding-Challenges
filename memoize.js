/*
Define a function memoize that takes one argument, a function, and returns a function.
  
When invoked, memoize creates an object that tracks calls to the returned function, where each input is associated with its output. Every subsequent call to that returned function with the same argument will return the output directly from the object, instead of invoking the original function again.
