// Write a function wereAwesome that takes you and your pair programming partner's name and returns the string "[your buddy's name] and [you] are awesome!"

// If you are coding on your own, get creative! Instead of a pair programming partner, it could be the name of your friend, your pet, or even your rubber ducky!

function wereAwesome(you, yourBuddy) {
  return `${yourBuddy} and ${you} are awesome!`;
}

// Uncomment the lines below to test your function:
console.log(wereAwesome("Dave", "Will")); // => "Will and Dave are awesome!"
console.log(wereAwesome("Victoria", "Jenny")); // => "Jenny and Victoria are awesome!"
console.log(wereAwesome("Chris", "Jac")); // => "Jac and Chris are awesome!"
console.log(wereAwesome("Phillip", "Skyler")); // => "Skyler and Phillip are awesome!"
